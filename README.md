## Martha Stewart TV Downloader

**What it does**
- Supports both collections of videos and individual videos.
- Downloads the episodes / videos with the title from the website.
- Downloads the subtitles (if they are available) in srt format.
- Downloads at the highest resolution available. 


**Other info**  
Downloads can be slow, but thats a server thing out of my control.

There isnt anything I can do about the episode naming convention, I know it sucks.

If an error happens, the program will dump the error to error.txt, if u contact me about the error, makes sure you send me the contents of that file so i know whats going on. 

Are you gonna steal my login info? No, im not, its kept in a local file called credentials.json thats created at first run, the only use of the login info is to login to the website.
